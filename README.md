### I-am-Something-of-a-Painter-Myself

The task is to build a GAN model that generates 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images. A GAN consists of at least two neural networks: a generator model and a discriminator model. The generator is a neural network that creates the images. This generator is trained using a discriminator. The two models will work against each other, with the generator trying to trick the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately classify the real vs. generated images.
